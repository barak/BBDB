*Directions For Converting (Installing) BBDB as a Package*

1. Move (unpack) the BBDB distribution into "`package-path'/lisp/bbdb".

2. Add `auto-autoload.el' (included here) into that directory.

3. Patch `bbdb-Makefile' with the patch included here.

4. Run `make install-pkg -f bbdb-Makefile'.

5. Re-dump XEmacs.
