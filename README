BBDB (The Insidious Big Brother Database) is a rolodex-like database
program for Emacs.  BBDB can hook into (insinuate) various Emacs
subsystems (email readers, news readers, etc) to automatically create,
display, and augment relevant entries from its database.  Filters are
provided to import/export in a variety of formats.
