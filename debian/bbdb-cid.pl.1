.SH NAME
bbdb-cid.pl \- Caller-ID-logger
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bbdb-cid.pl
.SH DESCRIPTION
Opens the modem and waits for it to print caller-ID data.  When it does,
it logs it to a file, parses it, and pops up a window using "xmessage".
If the number is present in your .bbdb file, it shows the name (or company)
associated with it.

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.
