.SH NAME
bbdb-srv \- Converts Mail-Headers to an Emacs-Lisp String.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B echo "Some Headers" | bbdb-srv
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script reads a block of message headers on stdin, and converts them
to an emacs-lisp string (quoting  all dangerous characters) and then 
uses the `gnudoit' program to cause a running Emacs process to invoke
the `bbdb-srv' function with that string.

This has the effect of causing the running Emacs to display the BBDB
record corresponding to these headers.

See the Emacs side of things in bbdb-srv.el for more info.

A trivial application of this is the shell command:

   echo 'From: Jamie Zawinski <jwz@netscape.com>' | bbdb-srv.perl

which will cause the corresponding record to be displayed.
A more interesting application of this is:

   setenv NS_MSG_DISPLAY_HOOK bbdb-srv.perl

which will hook BBDB up to Mozilla (Unix Netscape Mail and Netscape News
versions 3.0b2 and later only.)

Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.
