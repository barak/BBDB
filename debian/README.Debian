To enable bbdb support add a call to bbdb-initialize in your .emacs:

bbdb-initialize is a compiled Lisp function in `bbdb'.
(bbdb-initialize &rest TO-INSINUATE)

*Initialize the BBDB.  One or more of the following symbols can be
passed as arguments to initiate the appropriate insinuations.

 Initialization of mail/news readers:

   Gnus       Initialize BBDB support for the Gnus version 3.14 or
              older.
   gnus       Initialize BBDB support for the Gnus mail/news reader
              version 3.15 or newer.  If you pass the `gnus' symbol,
              you should probably also pass the `message' symbol.
   mh-e       Initialize BBDB support for the MH-E mail reader.
   rmail      Initialize BBDB support for the RMAIL mail reader.
   sendmail   Initialize BBDB support for sendmail (M-x mail).
   vm         Initialize BBDB support for the VM mail reader.
              NOTE: For the VM insinuation to work properly, you must
              either call `bbdb-initialize' with the `vm' symbol from
              within your VM initialization file ("~/.vm") or you
              must call `bbdb-insinuate-vm' manually from within your
              VM initialization file.

 Initialization of miscellaneous package:

   message    Initialize BBDB support for Message mode.
   reportmail Initialize BBDB support for the Reportmail mail
              notification package.
   sc         Initialize BBDB support for the Supercite message
              citation package.
   w3         Initialize BBDB support for Web browsers.

In bits.tar.gz is the bits/ Subdir of the bbdb-Source packaged.
The README there states this:

This is the collection of bits and pieces located on the net or mailed to me
by various folk that may or may not wind up in BBDB proper. They shouldn't
be considered part of the bbdb as-is, nor should you complain to me about
their failure to work.

Look at it if you find something useful. If there is enough demand for some of the
files i can install them with bbdb. Just ask me. :)

Trying to bring up-to-date, and make compatible with Emacs23 RMAIL.

Imported via:
 git cvsimport -v -C bbdb -s -k -u -a bbdb -d :pserver:anonymous@bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb
on 17-Nov-2009

(the -s -k was a bug, as it substitutes "-k" for "/" in tags, oops,
thus disabling the -k, double oops.)

Manually merged Debian patches and tagged Debian releases.

Note that the upstream CVS repo did not contain the ./configure file,
while the upstream .orig tarballs do.  I have left these out.

To do an incremental update with upstream changes:
 cd src/git/bbdb
 git cvsimport -v -i -r origin -k -u -a -d :pserver:anonymous@bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb bbdb
 gitk --all; git merge origin/origin


The default upstream build process compiles the .el files, and
therefore needs a working emacs.  The debian packaging process leaves
this to install time, so at build time we do not actually need an
emacs.  But the configure script looks for one anyway, in order to
produce a proper lisp/Makefile, whose execution is however deferred
until installation time.  Tweaking things to cause configuration to
not bail when no emacs is present is more trouble than just requiring
one at build time.  So that's what we do.
