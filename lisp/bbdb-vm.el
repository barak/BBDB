  "Automatically add labels to messages based on the mail-alias field.
Add this to `bbdb-notice-hook' and if using VM each message that bbdb
notices will be checked.  If the sender has a value in the
bbdb/vm-auto-add-label-field  in their BBDB record that
matches a value in `bbdb/vm-auto-add-label-list' then a VM
label will be added to the message.

This works great when `bbdb-user-mail-names' is set.  As a result
mail that you send to people (and copy yourself on) is labeled as well.

This is how you hook it in.
