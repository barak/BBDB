;;; This file adds the ability to define attributions for Supercite in
;;; a BBDB, enables you to retrieve your standard attribution from
;;; BBDB. If the from header in the mail to which you are replying only
;;; contains the e-mail address, the personal name is lookup in BBDB. You
;;; need Supercite to make this code work. The attribution os is stored
;;; under the key attribution.

;;; To use enable this code you will have to the "sc-consult" to your
;;; sc-preferred-attribution-list. This file sets variable if it is not
;;; set and isues an warning message if "sc-consult" is not included.
;;;
;;;   (setq sc-preferred-attribution-list
;;;     '("sc-lastchoice" "x-attribution" "sc-consult" 
;;;       "initials" "firstname" "lastname"))
;;;
;;;
;;; We also set the sc-attrib-selection-list below if is not bound, if
;;; you have your own special sc-attrib-selection-list, please add
;;; an expression as below:
;;;
;;;   (setq sc-attrib-selection-list
;;;        '(("sc-from-address" ((".*" . (bbdb/sc-consult-attr
;;;				       (sc-mail-field "sc-from-address")))))))
;;;
;;; And finally we set the sc-mail-glom-variable to enable the
;;; fetching of the name of person when there is only an e-mail
;;; address in the original mail:
;;; 
;;;  (setq sc-mail-glom-frame
;;;    '((begin                        (setq sc-mail-headers-start (point)))
;;;      ("^x-attribution:[ \t]+.*$"   (sc-mail-fetch-field t) nil t)
;;;      ("^\\S +:.*$"                 (sc-mail-fetch-field) nil t)
;;;      ("^$"                         (progn (bbdb/sc-default)
;;;  					 (list 'abort '(step . 0))))
;;;      ("^[ \t]+"                    (sc-mail-append-field))
;;;      (sc-mail-warn-if-non-rfc822-p (sc-mail-error-in-mail-field))
;;;      (end                          (setq sc-mail-headers-end (point)))))
