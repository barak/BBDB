To compile and install the BBDB:

  1) Configure the compilation process
       Edit the Makefile, setting (if necessary) the paths to the Mail
       and News reader(s), the XEmacs package installation paths (if
       applicable), and the miscellaneous (but still important) build
       tool names and paths.

  2) Build the BBDB
       To build the BBDB with support for all of the supported mail
       and news programs (gnus, mh-e, rmail, and vm), issue the
       command 'make all'.  (The BBDB also supports send-mail mode -
       support for it is automatically compiled in, regardless of the
       build options supplied) To build with support only for gnus,
       mh-e, rmail, and/or vm, issue the 'make' command with one or
       more of the following arguments: 'gnus', 'mh-e', 'rmail',
       and/or 'vm'.  To build the BBDB without support for any mail
       program (except for send-mail mode), issue the command
       'make bbdb'.

  3) Install the BBDB
       The three most typical installations are outlined below:

        a) In-place.
             i)   Follow steps 1 and 2
             ii)  Add the lisp subdirectory to the Emacs load-path
             iii) Add the tex subdirectory to the TeX
                  search path (can be done by adding the complete path
                  to the tex subdirectory to the environment variable
                  TEXINPUTS)
             iv)  Add the texinfo directory to the Info search path.
        b) "Normal".
             i)   Follow steps 1 and 2.
             ii)  Copy the .el and .elc files from the lisp
                  subdirectory to a directory on the Emacs load-path
                  (or make a new directory, copy the files to it, and
                  add the new directory to the load-path).
             iii) Copy the .tex files from the tex subdirectory to a
                  directory on the TeX search path (or make a new
                  directory, copy the files to it, and add the new
                  directory to the TeX search path.
             iv)  Copy the .info and .info-* files from the texinfo
                  subdirectory to a directory on the Info search path
                  (or make a new directory, copy the files to it, and
                  add the new directory to the Info search path)
        c) XEmacs Package
             NOTE: This installation option is only available to users 
                   running XEmacs 20.4 or higher.  At the time of this 
                   writing, this includes only XEmacs beta testers.
             i)    Follow steps 1 and 2, making sure to set the
                   appropriate variables in the XEmacs package
                   section.
             ii)   Issue the 'make install-pkg' command.
